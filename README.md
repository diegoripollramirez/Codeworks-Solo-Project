# Codeworks---Solo-Project
This project allows you to save your favorite recipes, plan and save your weekly meals with them and it makes a shopping list with all the ingredients you will need during the week.
You can also access the recipe from the schedule to folow the cooking instructions.

It uses a react client, a node express server and a mongodb data base.
